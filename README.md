# Python

Codes for simple problems available.

Questions are:

1. Cartons problem
Suppose a company manufacturing cardboard cartons gets a number of orders for cartons of various dimensions. 
The order details are recorded in a register mentioning the number of cartons as well as the length, breadth and height of each carton. 
The company needs to order the raw cardboard sheets which are available with a supplier in a fixed dimension specified in terms of the length and breadth of a sheet.
The supplier provides a choice of dimensions (but a set of fixed dimensions) to the company so that sheets of an optimum dimension may be ordered in any instance. 
Write a Python program that can read the order data from a text file (you may take it to any level of complexity) and calculate the number of sheets to be ordered from the supplier so as to satisfy the orders. 
Provide a simple interface to the company to get the required number of sheets.				

2. Translate function
Create a language based translator program that can translate user input given in the form of a text file into any one of the languages available for translation in Python’s translator function.
The text file and choice of language will be input by the user.
							
3. Super market problem
Create a list containing any four elements that are commonly available in the dairy section of any super market, say, My Super Store. Create a tuple corresponding to the expiry date of one of the products. Print the values of this tuple in the form of a string that reads “ The product will expire on <dd/mm/yyyy>”
Next, create an empty dictionary related to the chosen product. Add the following key/value pairs:
expiryDate : set it to the tuple mentioned above
size: Size/capacity of the product
MRP: Maximum retail price of the product as stipulated by the company
bestPrice: Price charged by the super market
brandName: Name of the brand
Make up the values or use a real unit of the product, for 10 units of the product.

Print out the values of all the elements of the dictionary using the values therein, (not for the instance using data in the tuple).
Let the program calculate the total price of the 10 units as charged by the super market, and the total savings in comparison to the MRP.
Append a new column to the dictionary called competePrice which contains the prices of the rival super market. Let the program compare the prices of the rival to the prices of My Super Store, considering the total price of the 10 units.


4. Speed related
Suppose the traffic police department approaches you with the problem of
monitoring the speed of drivers to get real time information. The permitted speed
limit is 70 kmph. For every 5 km above the speed limit (70), the driver is awarded
one demerit point. For example, if the speed is 80, 2 demerit points are awarded. If
the driver gets more than 12 points, his/her license will be suspended. Take the
speed as input and print information regarding adherence to speed limit, demerit
points (if any), and whether the license has to be suspended.


5. Upper case
Suppose a printer approaches you to automate the process of printing banners,
business cards and letter heads to some extent. His problem is simply to check if at
least 2 uppercase letters exist in the first four characters of the matter provided by
his clients and, if so, convert the entire string to uppercase. Help the printer to
automate this process.

6.  Sum of 3rd number
A mathematician wants to find the sum of the square of all the positive integers
smaller than a specified number. He wants to repeat this process for 15 given
numbers. But he only wants to print every third sum from the list of 15 sums and
discard it. He wants to repeat this process until the list becomes empty. Help him to
achieve his objective.

7. Currency related
A small shop owner in India wants to find the optimum number of notes (Sample of
notes: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000) in a given amount of money he has
collected. Help him get the answer.

8. Divisibility by 9
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 9 but are not
a multiple of 6, between 2000 and 3000 (both included). The numbers obtained
should be separated by commas and written to a .csv file in such a way that every line
should have 10 numbers.

9. Number of words

Save the following paragraph to a text file and write a program that reads from the
file, counts the number of times the phrase “Business Analytics” is used, and prints
the number to the console.
Business Analytics is a perfect blend of Data Science, Information Theory, Business
Intelligence and Computer Science. Its major aim is to change heavy data into
actionable intelligence by using different quantitative and statistical methods. To put
it simply, Business Analytics is concerned with mining data in order to get particular
business objectives; instead of focusing on measuring past performance, it is more
concerned with predictive and prescriptive techniques. Business Analytics is the
solution for the increasing demand for complex data analysis to solve business-related
problems. Business Analytics focuses on how to use relevant data to solve complex
business problems and maintain that particular data. It is all about analyzing past
performance of the company and making a strategy how it will perform in future and
take business decision accordingly. For instance - take a chain of shopping malls. One
can use Business Analytics to use data to understand where to open their next branch
for higher profits.

10. Comma seperated numbers
Use a list comprehension to square such numbers in a list that are divisible by 3. For
example, if a number is 36, since it is divisible by 3, its square should be passed to the
output list. If a number is 47, discard it. The input list is taken as user input of a
sequence of comma-separated numbers. The output list should contain only the
squares of the selected numbers.
