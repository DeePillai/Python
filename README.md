# Python

Codes for simple problems available.

Questions are:

1. Cartons problem
Suppose a company manufacturing cardboard cartons gets a number of orders for cartons of various dimensions. 
The order details are recorded in a register mentioning the number of cartons as well as the length, breadth and height of each carton. 
The company needs to order the raw cardboard sheets which are available with a supplier in a fixed dimension specified in terms of the length and breadth of a sheet.
The supplier provides a choice of dimensions (but a set of fixed dimensions) to the company so that sheets of an optimum dimension may be ordered in any instance. 
Write a Python program that can read the order data from a text file (you may take it to any level of complexity) and calculate the number of sheets to be ordered from the supplier so as to satisfy the orders. 
Provide a simple interface to the company to get the required number of sheets.				

2. Translate function
Create a language based translator program that can translate user input given in the form of a text file into any one of the languages available for translation in Python’s translator function.
The text file and choice of language will be input by the user.
							
3. Super market problem
Create a list containing any four elements that are commonly available in the dairy section of any super market, say, My Super Store. Create a tuple corresponding to the expiry date of one of the products. Print the values of this tuple in the form of a string that reads “ The product will expire on <dd/mm/yyyy>”
Next, create an empty dictionary related to the chosen product. Add the following key/value pairs:
expiryDate : set it to the tuple mentioned above
size: Size/capacity of the product
MRP: Maximum retail price of the product as stipulated by the company
bestPrice: Price charged by the super market
brandName: Name of the brand
Make up the values or use a real unit of the product, for 10 units of the product.

Print out the values of all the elements of the dictionary using the values therein, (not for the instance using data in the tuple).
Let the program calculate the total price of the 10 units as charged by the super market, and the total savings in comparison to the MRP.
Append a new column to the dictionary called competePrice which contains the prices of the rival super market. Let the program compare the prices of the rival to the prices of My Super Store, considering the total price of the 10 units.
